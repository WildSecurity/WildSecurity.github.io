This brought some more annoying challenges, namely debugging Ingest Pipelines and trying to figure out how this could be done in a more relaxed way. So here we go. The Ingest Pipelines First let’s get into what Ingest Pipelines are, and how they work. What are they? Dumbed down, they are a way to run an ELK St... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Building a Risk Model in Elastic</title><link href="https://wilddogone.github.io//posts/Elastic_Risk_Model/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Building a Risk Model in Elastic" /><published>2022-07-29T20:39:00+02:00</published> <updated>2022-08-02T08:17:27+02:00</updated> <id>https://wilddogone.github.io//posts/Elastic_Risk_Model/</id> <content src="https://wilddogone.github.io//posts/Elastic_Risk_Model/" /> <author> <name>WildDogOne</name> </author> <category term="elastic" /> <summary> Lately I have been thinking about how to do a risk scoring model in Elasticsearch. Yes I am aware that there are risk models for users and for hosts But these are heavily dependent on machine learning, and since I have no ML license, I thought it may be interesting to build something without ML. QRadar does this in a very similar fashion. The Process I built the whole thing on top of the exis... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Malicious Forms</title><link href="https://wilddogone.github.io//posts/MS_Forms/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Malicious Forms" /><published>2022-06-14T20:39:00+02:00</published> <updated>2022-06-14T20:39:00+02:00</updated> <id>https://wilddogone.github.io//posts/MS_Forms/</id> <content src="https://wilddogone.github.io//posts/MS_Forms/" /> <author> <name>WildDogOne</name> </author> <category term="Hunting" /> <category term="M365" /> <summary> Today we investigate a very interesting story. A user told us, he noticed his account was sending Microsoft Forms to internal people, and he believes he did not do that. The Alert Usually when a user tells us that their account is used to send out phishing, it’s very likely true positive. So we went ahead and checked this asap. But it got worse, the Mail was proven to be sent intra-org from a... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Building Elastic Security</title><link href="https://wilddogone.github.io//posts/Elastic_Security/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Building Elastic Security" /><published>2022-06-09T18:40:00+02:00</published> <updated>2022-06-09T19:59:33+02:00</updated> <id>https://wilddogone.github.io//posts/Elastic_Security/</id> <content src="https://wilddogone.github.io//posts/Elastic_Security/" /> <author> <name>WildDogOne</name> </author> <category term="elastic" /> <summary> Recently I have started to rebuild my home security setup. This included getting my Elastic Security up and running again. And in this blog entry I want to write a bit about it. However, since Elastic is such a vast topic, I will assume your stack is already up and running, no tshooting of that from me ;) Architecture In my personal opinion a modern installation of Elasticstack should look so... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Building Home Security</title><link href="https://wilddogone.github.io//posts/Building_Security/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Building Home Security" /><published>2022-06-09T17:39:00+02:00</published> <updated>2022-06-09T22:33:46+02:00</updated> <id>https://wilddogone.github.io//posts/Building_Security/</id> <content src="https://wilddogone.github.io//posts/Building_Security/" /> <author> <name>WildDogOne</name> </author> <category term="elastic" /> <summary> Recently I have been revamping my home security setup.
